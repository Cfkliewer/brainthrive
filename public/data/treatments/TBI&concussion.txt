🧠 How Medical-Grade Photobiomodulation Helps TBI Patients and Post Concussion Syndrome
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can disrupt brain function, causing symptoms like memory loss, brain fog, headaches, fatigue, mood changes, and difficulty focusing. Medical-grade PBM is a safe, non-invasive therapy that uses specific wavelengths of light to stimulate brain cells, reduce inflammation, and promote healing after injury.

🔬 What Happens in the Brain After TBI?
Swelling and inflammation damage brain tissue


Blood flow decreases, starving brain cells of oxygen and nutrients


Mitochondria (the cell’s energy source) become weakened, slowing recovery


Neural connections are disrupted, impairing memory, focus, and mood



💡 How PBM Helps the Injured Brain
Medical-grade PBM targets these problems directly by:
Increasing Cellular Energy (ATP)


Red light penetrates deep into brain tissue, energizing mitochondria to boost cell repair and speed recovery.


Reducing Brain Inflammation & Swelling


PBM calms overactive immune responses, decreasing swelling and protecting neurons from further damage.


Improving Blood Flow & Oxygen Delivery


Enhances circulation to injured brain areas, delivering oxygen and nutrients needed for healing.


Stimulating Neuroplasticity


PBM promotes growth of new neural connections, improving memory, focus, and brain function.


Balancing Brain Chemistry


Reduces anxiety and depression symptoms common after TBI by regulating neurotransmitters and calming overactive brain regions.



✅ Benefits Reported in TBI Patients
Better memory and focus


Reduced headaches and brain fog


Improved mood and sleep quality


Faster recovery and greater mental clarity



🛡️ Safe, Non-Invasive
Unlike medications, PBM is painless, drug-free, and has no downtime or side effects. It’s delivered using professional-grade devices in a controlled clinical setting.
Sessions last 20–30 minutes


Done in a clinical setting and customized for your brain
We use PBM combined with QEEG brain mapping to target the injury in the brain and track progress over time.
