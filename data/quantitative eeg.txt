What Is Medical-Grade Photobiomodulation (PBM)?
A Safe, Non-Invasive Therapy to Heal and Restore Your Brain and Body

🌟 What Is Photobiomodulation?
Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a safe, painless treatment that uses red and near-infrared light to gently stimulate your cells. This light helps your body heal by increasing energy at the cellular level, reducing inflammation, and improving circulation.

✅ Why “Medical-Grade” Matters
Medical-grade PBM goes deeper and works better than over-the-counter or wellness light devices.
 It’s:
🔬 Scientifically backed


🧠 Used in neurology clinics


👩‍⚕️ Supervised by trained professionals



⚙️ How Does It Work?
When light is applied to the skin and tissues:
Mitochondria (the cell’s energy center) absorb the light


They produce more ATP (energy)


Inflammation goes down, and healing speeds up

Brain entrainment - your brain will remain in the frequency of the therapy



🧠 What Can It Help With?
Medical-grade PBM is used for:
ADHD & focus support


Concussion & TBI recovery


Memory loss & brain fog


Anxiety & depression


Chronic pain


Inflammation & fatigue



💡 What to Expect
Sessions are relaxing and painless (you may feel a warm sensation)


Each treatment lasts around 10–20 minutes


PBM is often done multiple times per week for best results


No downtime, no medications, and no side effects
