🧠 How Medical-Grade PBM Helps ADHD & Autism
ADHD and Autism involve differences in brain activity, connectivity, and neurotransmitter function. These can affect focus, mood regulation, sensory processing, and behavior. Medical-grade photobiomodulation (PBM) uses safe, non-invasive red and near-infrared light to balance brain activity, reduce inflammation, and improve brain connectivity to support better cognitive and behavioral function.

🔬 What Happens in the Brain with ADHD & Autism?
ADHD: Often linked to underactive frontal brain regions, affecting attention, impulse control, and focus.


Autism (ASD): Often associated with brain network imbalances, sensory processing challenges, and inflammation in the nervous system.



💡 How PBM Supports Brain Function
Medical-grade PBM helps by:
Balancing Brain Activity


Normalizes overactive or underactive brain regions, improving focus and emotional regulation.


Enhancing Cellular Energy (ATP)


Stimulates mitochondria to increase brain cell energy, improving overall brain performance.


Reducing Neuroinflammation


Calms overactive immune responses in the brain, supporting clearer thinking and more stable moods.


Improving Brain Connectivity


Promotes neuroplasticity, strengthening pathways involved in attention, social skills, and learning.


Boosting Calm & Emotional Control


Helps regulate brain networks associated with anxiety, irritability, and hyperactivity, often seen in ADHD and Autism.



✅ Benefits Reported in ADHD & Autism Patients
Better focus and attention span


Improved emotional regulation and calmness


Reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity (ADHD)


Enhanced social interaction and communication (Autism)


Improved sleep and overall mood



🛡️ Safe and Non-Invasive
No medications, no pain, and no downtime


FDA-cleared technology used in clinical settings


Can be combined with QEEG brain mapping to track progress
